	<h1><STRONG>About Me</STRONG></h1>
<br><br>
<p> I’m an entrepreneur and meat popsicle, living in Nashville by way of Manhattan, South Los Angeles, Greene County, and C'Ville. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because nearly everything I want to do now requires a deep knowledge of web design, and the last time I had any training was in the Netscape Stone Age. It's time that I got up to speed. </p>
<br><br>
<h2><STRONG>My Mission</STRONG></h2>
<br> <br>
<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a writer/creator, putting together fictional universes and culture criticism as a full-time pursuit.</p>
<br><br>
